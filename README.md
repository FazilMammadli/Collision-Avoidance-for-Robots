## Methodology

### Environment Setup

The robot operates within a simulated environment created using Gazebo, which provides realistic physics and sensor data. The environment includes various obstacles and navigation goals to challenge the robot's navigation capabilities.
Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework

The DRL model is built using popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model receives inputs from the robot's sensors (e.g., LIDAR, cameras) and outputs navigation commands (e.g., linear and angular velocities).

### Reward Function

A crucial part of the DRL methodology is the design of the reward function, which incentivizes the robot to achieve desired behaviors. Rewards are given for reaching goals, avoiding obstacles, and maintaining efficient paths.

### Training Process

The DRL model is trained using a trial-and-error approach, where the robot explores the environment and learns from its interactions. The training process involves running multiple episodes, with each episode consisting of the robot starting at a random position and attempting to reach a goal.
Evaluation and Testing

After training, the model is evaluated in various scenarios to ensure its robustness and effectiveness. The trained model is tested in different environments to validate its generalization capability.
Deployment

Once validated, the trained DRL model can be deployed to a real robot with minimal modifications. ROS2 nodes handle communication between the DRL model and the robot's hardware.
